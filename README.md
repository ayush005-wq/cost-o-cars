### cost-o-cars

This project explores the prediction of second-hand car prices using basic multiple regression techniques.

## Dataset Description

# The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

**year**: The year the car was manufactured.
**selling_price**: The selling price of the car. (Target variable)
**km_driven**: The total distance the car has been driven (in kilometers).
**fuel**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel, CNG).
**seller_type**: The type of seller (e.g., individual, dealer).
**transmission**: The car's transmission type (e.g., manual, automatic).
**owner**: The number of previous owners the car has had.
**mileage (km/ltr/kg)**: The car's fuel efficiency (kilometers per liter or kilogram).
**engine_max_power**: The maximum power output of the car's engine.
**seats**: The number of seats in the car.
**seats_rating**: A rating of the car's seat comfort (potentially subjective).
Methodology

This project employs basic multiple regression to build a model that predicts the selling price of a used car based on the features mentioned above. 
# The steps involved include:

**Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning tasks.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution of features, identify relationships between features and the target variable (selling price), and potentially perform feature engineering.
**Model Building**: Train a multiple regression model using the prepared data.
**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error (MSE).
(Optional) Model Improvement: Based on the evaluation results, explore techniques to improve the model's accuracy, such as feature selection or hyperparameter tuning.
Project Deliverables

# This project will include the following deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook (or equivalent) containing the code for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
Documentation of the model's performance and insights gained from the analysis.
(Optional) Visualizations and interpretations of the model's coefficients.
Next Steps

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration of used car price prediction.  
# Here are some potential next steps:

Explore more advanced machine learning models, such as random forests or gradient boosting.
Incorporate additional features like car brand, model, and body type.
Account for geographical variations in car prices.
Develop a user-friendly interface for predicting car prices.
